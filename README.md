# Advent of Code 2021
My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) puzzles.

They are in Scala using `sbt` as the build tool. Running the program by default
executes the puzzle matching today's date (so run puzzle 1 on 1 December). To run
a specific puzzle, supply the day as a command line argument (i.e., `run 1` from
the sbt console, or `sbt "run 1"` from a command prompt). To run all puzzles in
order, use `run all`.

Inputs are not included in the repo. They should be placed in the "input" directory
in the root of the repository, using names `day<nn>.txt`.
